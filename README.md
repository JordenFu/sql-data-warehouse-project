# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, spanning the development of a data warehouse to the generation of insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**:  Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics and Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

This repository is my first SQL end-to-end project to showcase exertise in:
* SQL Development
* Data Architect
* Data Engineering
* ETL Pipeline Developer
* Data Modeling
* Data Analytics

## Project Requirements

#### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

* **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
* **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
* **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
* **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
* **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
